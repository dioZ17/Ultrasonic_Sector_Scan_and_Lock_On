# Ultrasonic_Sector_Scan_and_Lock_On

This is a simple code that controls a servo-mounted Ultrasonic sensor.
The sensors scans the rotation area of the servo that moves indefinately clockwise to counterclockwise. 
Upon meeting an obstacle close enough it stops and locks onto that object until the obstacle is retrieved and the sensor continues it's scan.
